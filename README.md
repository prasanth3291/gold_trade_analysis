# Gold Trade Analysis: Zambia and Democratic Republic of Congo (2017-2023)

## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing gold trade trends between **Zambia** and the **Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)** from 2017 to 2023. The study seeks to understand the trade dynamics and the economic, geopolitical, and environmental factors influencing gold exports from these countries. By leveraging data analysis and visualization techniques, the project reveals insights into trade patterns, volume fluctuations, and market trends.

## Objectives
The objectives of this study are:
1. To analyze historical price and trading volume data related to gold exports.
2. To examine the correlation between gold trade and geopolitical factors.
3. To assess the impact of specific events on gold trading activities in Zambia and DRC.
4. To provide a comprehensive understanding of the gold trade’s contribution to the economies of Zambia and the DRC.

## Data Collection
The data for this analysis was obtained from the **Comtrade UN Database**, which provides detailed annual export data for gold based on specific commodity codes. The dataset includes:
- **Export values**: Trade value in USD.
- **Volume of trade**: Quantitative data representing the amount of gold exported.
- **Time frame**: From 2017 to 2023, covering significant geopolitical and market changes.

## Data Preprocessing
The dataset underwent a series of preprocessing steps to ensure clarity and accuracy:
1. **Removing Unnecessary Columns**: Irrelevant columns such as "TypeCode", "FreqCode", and "RefPeriodId" were excluded to simplify the dataset.
2. **Handling Missing and Estimated Data**: Columns with a high proportion of missing or estimated values were removed to maintain the dataset’s integrity.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Only the essential columns—such as period, commodity code, quantity, net weight, and trade value—were retained.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The analysis employed visualizations such as **time series graphs**, **bar graphs**, and **box plots** to understand the trade trends and fluctuations over the years:
- **Trade Volume Trends**: Highlighting peaks and drops in trade volume for Zambia and DRC.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Trade values were compared with other global players, including BRICS nations, the USA, and the European Union (EU).

## Key Findings
1. **Zambia**: A steady decline in gold trade volume and value from 2017 to 2023. The trade value dropped from $95.28 million in 2017 to $45.68 million by 2023.
2. **Democratic Republic of Congo**: A sharp decline in gold exports post-2020, with the trade value decreasing from $95.28 million in 2017 to just $2.67 million by 2023.
3. **Trade with BRICS vs. Western Countries**: The volume of trade with BRICS nations was significantly higher than with Western nations like the USA and the EU.

## Methodology
The study used **pivot tables** in Excel to summarize and filter the data based on commodity codes and reporter countries (Zambia and DRC). Data mining techniques were used to assess:
- Overall trade value from Zambia and DRC.
- Comparative trade analysis with BRICS, the USA, and the EU.
- The impact of geopolitical factors on trade.

## Geopolitical Impact
### Zambia (2017-2023)
- **Mercury Regulations**: The 2017 enforcement of the **Minamata Convention on Mercury** led to a reduction in artisanal gold production.
- **Political Instability and Illegal Mining**: Reports of illegal gold mining activities caused major disruptions in the sector, complicating the tracking of gold exports.
- **Gold Tax Reforms**: Zambia introduced several tax reforms, leading to concerns about profitability and reduced foreign investments in mining.

### Democratic Republic of Congo (2017-2023)
- **Gold Smuggling**: Widespread illegal smuggling of gold from the DRC to neighboring countries resulted in significant revenue loss.
- **Political Instability**: Ongoing political challenges and the impact of the **COVID-19 pandemic** further hindered formal gold trade.
- **Impact of the Russia-Ukraine War**: The global commodity price increase due to the conflict boosted Zambia's export revenues, whereas the DRC faced difficulties with disrupted exports.

## Conclusion
This project provides an in-depth analysis of the gold trade between Zambia, DRC, and the global market. The study highlights the economic challenges faced by these countries due to geopolitical instability, illegal mining activities, and external global events. It also demonstrates the importance of maintaining secure and regulated mining and trade practices to optimize economic gains.
